<u><b>Simple Chat App created using the Pubnub SDK Version: 4.21.7</b></u><br>

Installation:

Used node server to host the app.<br>
run `npm install` to install all the in app dependencies.<br>
run `node index.js` to start the node app. It runs on port 3000.<br>
go to your browser and go to localhost:3000 to run your app.<br>
Enter a cool username and enter the appropriate channel you want. For demo purposes the channel is 'os'.<br>


<b>Things done so far:<b>

<ul>
	<li> Users can join a particular channel using a username </li>
	<li> Users can send messages to each other </li>
	<li> Implemented the 'is typing' feature </li>
	<li> also displays the number of live users in a particular channel </li>
</ul>

Future Works:
<ul>
	<li> Pubnub sdk has a option of storing the history of the past messages of a particular chat. It's very easy; just a few lines of code configuarion can do it. But for this demo purpose I haven't implemented this feature. </li>
	<li> Private Messaging between users </li>
	<li> File upload </li>
</ul>
